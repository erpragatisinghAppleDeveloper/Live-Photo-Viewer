# Live Photo Viewer
iOS 9 Project demonstrating how to animate Live Photos in view.

This demo brings up an image picker from which you can select Live Photos. Choosing a non-Live-Photo will bring up an alert.

The image is then presented in a Live Photo View, which comes free with a force touch recogniser, just like in the Photos app. In addition there are two buttons at the bottom to animate the Live Photo manually. Choose between the short "hint" type animation, or the full animation.
